# MongoDB Aggregation: Handling Empty Arrays in $unwind
This example demonstrates a common error when using the `$unwind` stage in MongoDB aggregation pipelines.  The `$unwind` operator is used to deconstruct an array field from each input document into multiple documents, one for each element in the array. However, if the array field is empty, the `$unwind` stage will fail, causing the entire aggregation to halt.

The bug showcases this issue, while the solution provides a robust way to handle empty arrays using `$ifNull` or `$cond` operators to prevent the pipeline from failing.
